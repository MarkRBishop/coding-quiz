## Description

This project is a simple quiz to test a user's knowledge of certain coding languages.  It's sort of like flash cards with multiple choice answers. It can be a useful tool for studying, or even teaching someone about coding. It is easily expandable and/or change to be able to ask different questions if desired as its dynamically created. 

During the build process of this application, I learned a lot about JavaScript and its usefulness to change a static html page into something that can change drastically with a click of a button. 

## Usage

It's a fairly straight forward program, with a set of instructions on the page load. After page load, and reading the instructions, a user only needs to press the start button to get started. During the quiz, it will ask a series of questions within the alloted time, which you can find in the top right corner. Once you've clicked on your chosen answer, it moves on to the next question. Provided you get it wrong however, it deducts 10 seconds from the timer. It will continue to ask questions until the timer runs out, or the user has completed the quiz.
After completion of the quiz, it will log how much time is left on the timer and that's your score. It also prompts the user to input their initials to be logged and ranks them versus other attempts in a high score card. You can visit this card at any point in the application, including the initial page load. Assuming a user is using the same browser, the scores will stay logged in their local storage. You can however clear this with the click of a button in the highscore tab.
